# Generalized Nash Equilibrium Models for River Systems
These files consist of the python source code and Jupyter notebooks used to generate the mathematical model results for our paper on Generalized Nash Line Graph Games. 
The paper, which provides details on the model, can be found at the following link:

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2023.106194

The python source code implements the Python API for version 43 of the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). Installing the API is required to run this source code. Documentation for installing the API can be found here:

https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/API_PY_GETTING_STARTED.html

A GAMS license including the PATH solver is also required to solve the equilibrium model in the source code.

The root directory of my GAMS software is in the C drive. If yours is not, then you will need to change the path in line 469 of the .py file.
